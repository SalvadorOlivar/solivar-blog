## About this Blog

The intention behind this blog is to document my learning journey and share insights about the technologies I explore. I wanted to learn TypeScript, and what better way to do so than through a mini-project?

This project allowed me to get hands-on experience with Next.js and TypeScript. As a first encounter with these technologies, it has been a valuable learning experience. I hope to continue improving and expanding my knowledge in the future.
